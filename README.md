# 🧮 Canteen Insights – SQL + Excel Analysis Project  
A beginner-friendly data analytics project that explores how students interact with a college canteen — analyzing food preferences, order behavior, and spending trends using SQL and Excel.

## 📌 Project Summary  
This project simulates a real-world canteen dataset and analyzes student purchasing behavior across various factors such as academic year, food item popularity, department spending, and order frequency. The insights are extracted through SQL queries and visualized through Excel dashboards.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Food Trend Analysis  
Identifies:
- Most popular food items (by quantity sold)
- Items frequently ordered in bulk (quantity > 1)
- Top 5 most active student customers

### ✅ Order Behavior Breakdown  
Analyzes:
- Year-wise order frequency
- Department-wise average spend per order

### ✅ SQL Skill Demonstration  
Includes use of:
- `JOIN` across multiple tables (`orders`, `students`, `menu`)
- Aggregation functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- Filtering (`WHERE`), grouping (`GROUP BY`), sorting (`ORDER BY`)
- Smart use of calculated fields (`price × quantity`)


## 📁 Files Included  
`canteen_insights_queries.sql`  
> SQL file with 5 key queries + comments explaining each one

`canteen_data.xlsx`  
> Contains:
- Sample dataset (Students, Orders, Menu)
- Calculated columns for pricing and quantity

  
## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- SQLite (SQLiteOnline or DB Fiddle)  
- Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets  
- SQL (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHERE, LIMIT)
  

## 💡 Use Case  
This project reflects how aspiring Product Analysts or Product Managers can:
- Analyze behavioral data from a transactional system (e.g., canteen)
- Use SQL to explore usage trends, preferences, and profitability
- Build simple dashboards for non-technical stakeholders
